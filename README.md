## Development

> IMPORTANT! This project uses Git LFS so I think you would need that installed?

A copy of ffmpeg must be available on your PATH if you plan on recording
animations.

To get OSX to shut up about ffmpeg permissions on MacOS run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
```

To create a new sketch, copy one of the existing ones from the
[src/sketches](src/sketches) folder or start from scratch with
[src/sketches/template.mjs](src/sketches/template.mjs). All sketches in this
folder are available to load in the UI
