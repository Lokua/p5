Exploratory sketches made with p5.js

Stuff like this:

<img src="images/1000x/grid4-u2m4.png" alt="images/1000x/grid4-u2m4.png" width="400">

You can see more here on github by looking at the auto
generated [markdown index](index.md)

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in browser

## Development

A copy of ffmpeg must be available on your PATH.

To get OSX to STFU about ffmpeg permissions run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
```

To create a new sketch, copy one of the existing ones from
the [sketches](src/sketches) folder. All sketches in this
folder are available to load in the UI
